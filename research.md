# About me

I did my PhD in Mathematics and Computer Science at [Inria Grenoble](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/grenoble/welcome-inria-grenoble-rhone-alpes). My doctoral work within the [Bipop research team](http://www.inrialpes.fr/bipop/) focused on the numerical mechanics of thin elastic structures in contact. I also taught several applied math courses at [ENSIMAG](http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/l-ensimag/) in the Grenoble Institute of Technology.

I'm currently a Machine Learning Engineer in industry and have worked in the Autonomous Driving and Healthcare areas. 

Below is a list of my publications.
