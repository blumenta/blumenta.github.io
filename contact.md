About me

In my last position I was a Research Engineer in autonomous driving at [Inria Grenoble](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/grenoble/welcome-inria-grenoble-rhone-alpes).
I'm currently looking for an R&D position in industry as a Machine Learning engineer working in cutting edge AI technologies.
