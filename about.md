# About me

I'm a PhD student in Mathematics and Computer Science at [Inria Grenoble](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/grenoble/welcome-inria-grenoble-rhone-alpes). My work within the [Bipop research team](http://www.inrialpes.fr/bipop/) focuses on the numerical mechanics of thin elastic structures in contact. I also teach several applied math courses at [ENSIMAG](http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/l-ensimag/) in the Grenoble Institute of Technology.
